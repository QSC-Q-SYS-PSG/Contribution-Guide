# Coding conventions

## Coding notes

The following note types are recommended:
- `TODO:` Things in the code to do
- `WARN:` Dangerous notes
- `FIXME:` Things that will need fixing later
- `REVIEW:` Note things that should be reviewed later
- `HACK:` To make notes of a questionable work around
- `REF:` Used for annotating references used for the code

## In code documentation

!> Please document your code properly

Use the [emmy lua](https://emmylua.github.io/) standards to document objects and functions.

Comment regularly through the code either above or alongside each step so that others can understand what you are doing.

## Formatting

Use of [Lua format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Koihik.vscode-lua-format) allows you to format code consistently.
